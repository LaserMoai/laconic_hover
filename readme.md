> A browser extension which shows Laconic text when hovering on a TV Tropes link.

TV Tropes is great but its even better when you have the power of a million tropes in the palm of your hand.

## Install

- [**Chrome** extension][link-cws] [<img valign="middle" src="https://img.shields.io/chrome-web-store/v/ignndocldlheghlflchdbokagecncgmm.svg?label=%20">][link-cws]

## How?

This used to be a Userscript but its become more of a fully fledged extension. The core of this extension works by fetching "laconic pages" in the TV Tropes wiki. These are ["subpages ... for brief statements describing the core idea of the page they are attached to."](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaconicWiki)  Thankfully many pages have them and they're very helpful for navigating if you don't know every Trope off by heart. This extension attempts to make a request to the laconic page of any Trope link you happen to be hovering on. If a Laconic page exists, the html is displayed, otherwise an error message is displayed.

This extension uses [tippy.js](https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/) for controlling and displaying hovering elements, which is super neat!

## Hasn't this been done before?

Yes, I think so:
\[[1](http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/130346)]
\[[2](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tropes-helper-beta/nbmecnaokkbfonmbplonmnekhiklkjlm)]  
But neither were ever updated, hopefully this will be different.

## Development

See the npm scripts for more information. To get started make sure [Node.jsÂ®](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed. You can then clone the repo and install the repositories:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/spookyUnknownUser/laconic_hover
cd laconic_hover
npm install
```

If you want to play around with the project do the following:

`npm run watch`

This will make webpack watch for any changes and output the unpacked extension to `/distribution/`.  
Now you're ready to start editing the project. You can go straight into `/source/` and mess around if you want.

To see your changes I recommend using firefox because it automatically reloads your changes and can be launched from the project by running:

`npm run start:firefox`

To build for production just run `npm run build`

For more information see [contributing.md](contributing.md).

I would also like to especially thank [@sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus) and anyone else involved in [refined-github](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github/) for figuring out how to structure a modern web extension and making it easy to copy that structure :)
